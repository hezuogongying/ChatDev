                return True

def print_board(board):
    print(np.flip(board, 0))

board = create_board()
game_over = False
turn = 0

while not game_over:
    # 让玩家1下棋
    if turn == 0:
        col = int(input("玩家1，请输入列号(0-14): "))
        if is_valid_location(board, col):
            row = get_next_open_row(board, col)
            drop_piece(board, row, col, 1)
            if winning_move(board, 1):
                print("玩家1获胜!")
                game_over = True

    # 让玩家2下棋
    else:
        col = int(input("玩家2，请输入列号(0-14): "))
        if is_valid_location(board, col):
            row = get_next_open_row(board, col)
            drop_piece(board, row, col, 2)
            if winning_move(board, 2):
                print("玩家2获胜!")
                game_over = True

    print_board(board)
    turn += 1
    turn = turn % 2  # 切换玩家

```

您可以将上述代码复制到Python环境中，并运行它。这个程序让两名玩家轮流下棋，当有一名玩家连成五子时，游戏结束并宣布胜利。祝您玩得愉快！
